Don't be so na?ve as to believe that you can turn into a superman just because you learned something new yesterday. Translating knowledge into meaningful action takes much more time than you��ve ever imagined. Relax, take it easy, and don't rush. You can lift a very heavy weight, but without proper training you can hurt yourself.
